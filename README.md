Successfully Completed Project on Food Delivery Using MERN Stack

I recently led the development of a comprehensive food delivery application utilizing the MERN stack MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and Stripe integration. This project showcased my proficiency in full-stack development and the ability to deliver a robust and scalable solution.

User Module: The application featured a user module with secure login/logout functionality, allowing users to seamlessly navigate and manage their food orders. They could add items to their cart, proceed to checkout with Stripe for secure payments, and track their orders through stages like processing, out for delivery, and delivered.

Admin Module: I designed a comprehensive admin portal. This portal enabled efficient management of food items through functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting items. Admins could oversee incoming orders, manage order statuses, and ensure timely fulfillment through a streamlined order tracking system.

Frontend Development: Leveraged React.js to create a responsive and engaging user interface, enhancing the overall user experience with seamless navigation and real-time updates. I also created a custom logo for "Food Magic," which played a key role in establishing the application's brand and visual identity.

Backend Infrastructure: Utilized Node.js and Express.js to build robust APIs and handle server-side logic, ensuring data integrity and efficient communication between the frontend and MongoDB database.

Payment Integration: Integrated Stripe to facilitate secure and reliable payment processing, meeting industry standards for transaction security and user trust.
